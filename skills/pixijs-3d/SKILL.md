PixiJS 3D (`@pixi/3d`) is PixiJS's 3D extension. A `View3D` is an ordinary 2D display object on the Pixi stage that renders a 3D scene into its rectangle, so 3D and 2D mix freely. The scene hangs from `view.root`, the view owns its `camera`, lights are nodes in the scene, and the Pixi application ticker is the frame loop.

This file gives you the mental model, a complete starting app, and the conventions that catch people. The `references/` folder has one complete, runnable recipe per job; open the one you need.

For a signature or option this skill doesn't cover, fetch the class's API page: `https://3d.pixijs.download/release/docs/<module>.<Class>.html.md` (scene.View3D, materials.Material3D, extras_camera.OrbitCamera, maths.Vector3). To find a class's module, or a guide on a topic, look it up in `https://3d.pixijs.download/release/docs/llms.txt`.

## Quick Start

A lit scene with shadows, two primitives, a loaded model and mouse orbit controls. Complete src/main.ts for a Vite + TypeScript app with `pixi.js` and `@pixi/3d` installed.

```ts
import {
  CubeGeometry,
  DirectionalLight,
  Material3D,
  Mesh3D,
  Model3D,
  PlaneGeometry,
  SphereGeometry,
  View3D,
} from '@pixi/3d';
import type { Scene3DSource } from '@pixi/3d';
import { OrbitCamera } from '@pixi/3d/extras';
import { Application, Assets } from 'pixi.js';

const app = new Application();
await app.init({ resizeTo: window, backgroundColor: 0x87b7e6, antialias: true });
document.body.appendChild(app.canvas);

// A View3D is a 2D display object that renders a 3D scene into its rectangle.
const view = new View3D({
  autoResize: true,
  shadowQuality: 'medium',
  environment: { skyColor: 0xbcd4f0, groundColor: 0x6b6250, intensity: 0.7 }, // hemisphere fill light
});
app.stage.addChild(view);

// Lights are nodes under view.root. Lights and cameras face their local -Z axis.
const sun = new DirectionalLight({ color: 0xfff2dc, intensity: 3, castShadow: true });
sun.rotation.set(-Math.PI / 4, Math.PI / 6, 0);
view.root.addChild(sun);

// PlaneGeometry lies in XY with a +Z normal: rotate it -90° around X to make a floor.
const ground = new Mesh3D({
  geometry: new PlaneGeometry({ width: 30, height: 30 }),
  material: new Material3D({ baseColor: 0x7f8f6a, roughness: 0.95, metallic: 0 }),
  rotation: { x: -Math.PI / 2, y: 0, z: 0 },
  castShadow: false,
  receiveShadow: true,
});
view.root.addChild(ground);

// Meshes take a geometry and a material. Options objects set position, rotation, scale, shadows.
view.root.addChild(
  new Mesh3D({
    geometry: new CubeGeometry({ width: 2, height: 2, depth: 2 }),
    material: new Material3D({ baseColor: 0xd9534f, roughness: 0.6, metallic: 0 }),
    position: { x: -3, y: 1, z: 0 },
  }),
  new Mesh3D({
    geometry: new SphereGeometry({ radius: 1.2 }),
    material: new Material3D({ baseColor: 0x4a90d9, roughness: 0.3, metallic: 0.2 }),
    position: { x: 3, y: 1.2, z: 0 },
  }),
);

// Models: load a glTF/GLB with Assets, then wrap the source in a Model3D.
const source = await Assets.load<Scene3DSource>('/assets/models/Duck.glb');
// The file's own node transforms set its size (this duck is about 1.6 units); read duck.getLocalBounds() before scaling.
const duck = new Model3D({ source, position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 3 } });
view.root.addChild(duck);

// The view owns its camera. OrbitCamera (extras) drives it from the mouse.
view.camera.position.set(0, 5, 12);
view.camera.lookAt({ x: 0, y: 1, z: 0 });
new OrbitCamera({ view, enableDamping: true });

// Per-frame work goes on the application ticker.
app.ticker.add((ticker) => {
  duck.rotation.y += 0.01 * ticker.deltaTime;
});
```

## Conventions

- **Scene graph.** Everything 3D goes under `view.root` (a `Container3D`); a mesh on `app.stage` does nothing useful. Nodes have `position`, `rotation` (Euler radians), `quaternion`, `scale`, `visible`, `lookAt(point)`, `addChild`, `traverse(callback)` over a subtree, and bounds via `getLocalBounds()`.
- **Options objects.** Constructors take one options object: `new Mesh3D({ geometry, material, position: { x, y, z }, castShadow, parent: view.root })`. The same values are plain properties afterwards (`mesh.position.set(x, y, z)`).
- **Camera.** `view.camera` is a `Camera3D`: `fov` is the vertical field of view in **degrees** (default 60), `near` 0.1, `far` 1000, `mode` `'perspective'` or `'orthographic'` with `orthographicSize` (half the view's **width** in world units, default 5). Aim it with `position.set(...)` and `lookAt(point)`.
- **Facing.** Cameras and lights look down their local -Z; meshes and glTF models face +Z. A `DirectionalLight` is aimed by its `rotation` (or `lookAt`), not a target.
- **Planes.** `PlaneGeometry` lies in the XY plane with a +Z normal. For a floor, rotate it -π/2 around X.
- **Primitive options.** `CubeGeometry({ width, height, depth })`, `SphereGeometry({ radius })`, `CylinderGeometry({ radiusTop, radiusBottom, height })` (no `radius`), `ConeGeometry({ radius, height })`, `CapsuleGeometry({ radius, height })` (height includes the caps), `TorusGeometry({ radius, tube })` (lies in XZ), `PlaneGeometry({ width, height })`, `IcosahedronGeometry({ radius, detail })`. Each also takes segment counts.
- **Lighting.** `DirectionalLight`, `PointLight`, `SpotLight`, `AmbientLight` are nodes. Soft fill comes from the view's `environment`: `{ skyColor, groundColor, intensity }` for a hemisphere, or a `CubeTexture` (`.cubemap` or `.hdr` via `Assets.load`) for image-based lighting. Shadows: `castShadow` on the light, `castShadow` / `receiveShadow` on meshes, `shadowQuality` (`'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'ultra'`) on the view.
- **Materials.** `Material3D` is physically based (`baseColor`, `metallic`, `roughness`, `baseColorTexture`, `alphaMode`, `alpha`); glow is an opt-in group, `emissive: { color, strength }`, never a plain colour. `FlatMaterial` is unlit. Custom looks come from shader bits in `extraBits`, not a ShaderMaterial class. `material.clone(options)` copies a material with options changed or bits added.
- **Models.** `Assets.load<Scene3DSource>(url)` then `new Model3D({ source })`. Animation clips play through `model.player`. Models from one source share its materials; `model.materials` gives one model its own.
- **Extras.** `OrbitCamera`, `FPSCamera`, `ParticleSystem3D`, `BloomEffect`, `SsaoEffect`, `TiltShiftEffect`, `MotionBlurEffect`, `TintEffect`, `FxaaEffect`, `ToonMaterial`, `PortalPass`, `PortalMaterial`, `dissolveBit` live in `@pixi/3d/extras`.
- **Many copies.** `BatchedMesh3D` draws thousands of instances in one call (`setMatrixAt`, `setInstanceDataAt`). Separate `Mesh3D` nodes batch into instanced draws on their own when they share a geometry, the same kind of material and the same texture _sources_: the frames of one sprite sheet count as one source, so `Sprite3D`s or textured meshes showing different frames of one sheet still draw together. Pack one effect's images into one sheet.
- **2D over 3D.** HUD text, buttons and sprites are ordinary Pixi objects added to the stage after the view. `view.worldToScreen(point)` places a 2D label at a 3D position; it always draws over the 3D. For a picture inside the scene that walls can hide, use `new Sprite3D({ texture, height, billboardMode, parent: view.root })`.
- **The app around it is pixi.js.** `Application` and `await app.init`, `Assets`, `Text`, pointer events and the ticker are pixi.js v8; when the `pixijs` skill is installed, use it for those.
- **Renderers.** `app.init` uses WebGL unless you pass `preference: 'webgpu'`; nothing else in your code changes. MSAA is `app.init({ antialias: true })`; `View3D` has no `antialias` option.
- **No enums.** Options like `shadowQuality`, `alphaMode` and `mode` are string literals. There is no `LightType` or `ShadowQuality` enum.

## Pitfalls that fail silently

Each line is the fix; its link owns the rule. These run without errors and draw or behave wrongly. Check the groups for what you built.

**Scene graph and math**

- `lookAt`, `reparentChild` and loaded glTF nodes set `quaternion`, and a node turns by whichever of `rotation` or `quaternion` was written last: on those nodes `rotation.y += x` replaces the real turn, so turn them with `quaternion.multiply(q)`. [scene-graph](references/scene-graph.md)
- `addChild` keeps a node's local numbers, so it jumps to the same offset under its new parent; `reparentChild` keeps its place in the world. [scene-graph](references/scene-graph.md)
- `view.root` holds the camera: clearing or hiding `view.root` makes rendering throw. Put level content under its own `Container3D` and clear that. [scene-graph](references/scene-graph.md)
- `getLocalBounds()` is in the node's own space and leaves out hidden children: for a world box use `getLocalBounds().applyMatrix4(node.getGlobalTransform())`. [math](references/math.md)
- `Vector3` math works in place (`a.add(b)` changes `a`; pass an `out` to keep it) and uses `subtract`, `multiplyScalar`, `magnitude` and `copyFrom`. A node's `position` is live, so copy what you keep. [math](references/math.md)
- A ground plane at height `h` is `new Plane(new Vector3(0, 1, 0), -h)` (note the minus), or `setFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint`. [math](references/math.md)

**Light and colour**

- Views default to `toneMapping: 'none'`, where lit colour clips above 1: set `toneMapping: 'aces'` for strong lights, HDR environments or bloom. [environment-and-sky](references/environment-and-sky.md)
- Porting from Three.js: a HemisphereLight(sky, ground, i) becomes `environment: { skyColor, groundColor, intensity: i / Math.PI }`; directional, point, spot and ambient intensities port 1:1. [from-threejs](references/from-threejs.md)
- Direct lights and `AmbientLight` are divided by π and the hemisphere is not: a sun near 3 and a hemisphere near 0.7 light `baseColor` fully, and an `AmbientLight` of 0.2 is barely visible. [scene-and-lighting](references/scene-and-lighting.md)
- Vertex colours are linear light: convert sRGB picks with `srgbToLinear`, or mid tones come out pale. [geometry](references/geometry.md)
- A view shades 32 lights and 16 shadow maps; past 256 casters the sun's shadow box is measured once, so call `sun.fitShadowBounds()` after the scene changes. [scene-and-lighting](references/scene-and-lighting.md)

**Surfaces**

- `alphaMode` defaults to `'opaque'`, which ignores `alpha` and texture alpha (transparent PNG texels draw black): set `'blend'` or `'mask'`. [materials](references/materials.md)
- A `'mask'` cut-out, or a shader bit that moves or discards vertices (`dissolveBit`), still casts the whole undisplaced shadow and outline: give it `castShadow: false` and `material.disablePass('outline')` if that shows. [materials](references/materials.md), [custom-shaders](references/custom-shaders.md)
- Images show upside down on `PlaneGeometry` unless `flipV: true`, and on `CubeGeometry` faces unless the material has `uvTransform: new Matrix(1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1)` (`Matrix` from pixi.js). [from-threejs](references/from-threejs.md)
- A `ContainerTexture` on an opaque material draws black where the 2D is transparent: add a backdrop, `clearColor`, or `alphaMode: 'blend'`. [render-to-texture](references/render-to-texture.md)

**Models and animation**

- A glTF file's own node transforms already size it and stand it Y-up facing +Z: read `getLocalBounds()` before scaling and add no fix-up rotation. [models-and-animation](references/models-and-animation.md)
- A loaded model draws its source's materials, so a write to one changes every model from that file: give one model copies with `model.materials = (m) => m.clone()`, and build a changed loaded material with `clone(options)`, not `new Material3D`, which drops its textures. [models-and-animation](references/models-and-animation.md)
- Most bones aren't scene nodes, so `getChildByLabel('Hand', true)` returns null: use `model.skeletons[0]`. [models-and-animation](references/models-and-animation.md)
- Write into `mesh.weights`; assigning a new array disconnects it from the clips that animate it. [models-and-animation](references/models-and-animation.md)
- A `Mesh3D` with no geometry or material draws nothing and raises no error. [geometry](references/geometry.md)

**Input and cameras**

- `OrbitCamera`, `FPSCamera`, `ParticleSystem3D` and a model's animation `player` update themselves on `Ticker.shared`, not `app.ticker`, so their step can land after your frame's code or a frame late: pass `autoUpdate: false` and call `update(ticker)` from your `app.ticker` callback when order matters (`orbit.update()` returns `true` when the camera moved). [cameras](references/cameras.md)

- 3D nodes default to `eventMode: 'passive'`: set `'static'` (also a `Mesh3D` option) or nothing picks. `pointertap` fires for every mouse button, so check `e.button`. [picking-and-input](references/picking-and-input.md)
- A full-screen view hit-tests its whole rectangle, so it blocks clicks to 2D objects behind it: put interactive 2D above the view or set `view.hitArea`. [2d-and-3d-together](references/2d-and-3d-together.md)
- `OrbitCamera.enabled = false` only stops input; `update()` keeps re-aiming the camera, so also set `autoUpdate = false` (or `destroy()`) before moving the camera yourself. [cameras](references/cameras.md)
- `FPSCamera` walking follows the pitch, so looking down sinks the camera: re-pin `position.y` after `update()` for a ground walker. [cameras](references/cameras.md)

**Effects and render to texture**

- `BloomEffect`'s threshold is 1 in linear light: make glowing things `emissive` with `strength` above 1; a threshold near 0.5 blooms every lit surface. MSAA carries through effects, so add `FxaaEffect` only without `antialias`. [post-processing](references/post-processing.md)
- A camera feed shown on a mesh under a filmic curve (`'aces'`) goes through the curve twice and looks washed out; `format: 'rgba16float'` is the documented fix with bloom-style effects, but on a `FlatMaterial` monitor it currently draws too dark, so compare the screen with the scene by eye, or show the feed in a 2D `Sprite`. Make feeds with `antialias: true` or their edges are jagged. [render-to-texture](references/render-to-texture.md)
- Toggle effects with `enabled`; adding the first or removing the last pre-curve effect recompiles every material. [post-processing](references/post-processing.md)

**Particles**

- `ParticleContainer3D` shows nothing until `upload()` after `setParticleAt`. [particles](references/particles.md)

**Current library limitations** (workarounds until they're fixed)

- A glTF mesh without normals (Fox.glb is one) lights as if every face pointed +Z, black when it turns away: rebuild flat normals with `getAttributeData`. [from-threejs](references/from-threejs.md)
- `SphereGeometry` maps images mirrored left to right: `uvTransform: new Matrix(-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)` plus `rotation.y = Math.PI` fixes it. [from-threejs](references/from-threejs.md)
- A `Sprite3D` created with no `position`, `scale` or `anchor` draws 1×1 units instead of its texture size until one of them changes: always pass a `position`. [2d-and-3d-together](references/2d-and-3d-together.md)
